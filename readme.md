By Ingo, Liu JunHao, Samuel Koh, Gabriel Tang, Mikail Jnr and Jeniece Tham  

This respository is the code we wrote for the Seoul Garden challenge statement 

# Features
The Flask project attempts to simulate an experience ordering food from a restaurant with a chatbot  
DISCLAIMER: This is just a project statement and WILL NOT have real functionality in ordering actual food.  
Credits to Seoul Garden for food images (ONLY FOR REFERENCE) to simulate the experience.  
1) Create and authenticate accounts 
2) Use an AI model to promote and give suggestions on deals, using information from order histories
3) Order food online
